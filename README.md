# Simple MQTT Client

:construction: This project is still under development. :construction:

This repo contains a simple PyQt5 and Python based MQTT client application. It uses the Paho MQTT library for 
communication with MQTT brokers, and can be used for publishing and subscribing to topics, as well as for viewing 
message payloads. I make this just for fun hehe.
